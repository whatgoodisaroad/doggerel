# Declare some dimensions;
dim length;
dim time;

# Declare some time units:
unit second of time;
unit minute of time;
unit hour of time;
convert minute to second with minute = 60 * second;
convert hour to minute with hour = 60 * minute;

# Declare some length units:
unit meter of length;
unit kilometer of length;
unit mile of length;
convert kilometer to meter with kilometer = 1000 * meter;
convert kilometer to mile with mile = 1.60934 * kilometer;

# Use them:
let accelerationDueToGravity = 9.81 meter/second^2;
let timeToImpact = 4.2 second;
let speedAtImpact = accelerationDueToGravity * timeToImpact;

# Print the resulting value in the desured alternative units.
print speedAtImpact as mile/hour;
